### As a user, I want to:

  so that I can have my own personal concert list at my disposal.

  so that I can see the upcoming events in that area.

- **Be able to save concerts I am interested in**,  
  so that I can have access to their information at my disposal.

- **Be able to delete a concert from my saved list**,  
  so that I can remove the specific event if I am no longer interested in it.

- **Be able to get more info about a specified concert and be directed to the ticket seller's website**,  
  so that I can decide if I would like to purchase a ticket or not.

- **Be recommended nearby hotels to the location I searched**,  
  so that I have options for housing if I so need.
